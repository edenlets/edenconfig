            "review": "We booked a stay at Eden Garden Lodge at short notice as our plans to stay with family fell through due to Covid..after a frantic scramble to find somewhere else to stay for the weekend...we were so relieved to find Eden lodge at a reasonable price and that looked decent. On arrival we were even more impressed. It far exceeded our expectations...it was lovely! looked to be newly furnished and everywhere was immaculately clean. It was also well heated. Great kitchen, well equipped with dishwasher too, Eve has thought of everything!..even down to a pizza cutter and tray! The Sitting area was great, as were both bedrooms, all beautifully decorated with plenty of space. The beds were really comfy and we had a great night's sleep both nights...it was soooo blissfully quiet too! Bathroom was great, recenly fitted, constant hot water. I nearly forgot to mention, the nice touches that made it that bit more special, the slippers on our beds with Eden garden logo towels and shower gel and soap in the bathroom. Can't recommend highly enough!...we'd definitely stay again, 5 stars!"
